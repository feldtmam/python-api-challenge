Analysis

1. Temperature seems to have a clear correlation with latitude. As expected, there is an increase in temperature for cities situated near    the equator and a sharp decrease in temperature for cities further south of the equator.
2. There is no strong relationship between latitude and humidity.
3. The relationship between latitude and cloudiness is also weak. 
4. There is also no strong relationship between latitude and wind speed. Although there are a couple of outliers above 30 mph winds, it is    not significant enought to warrant discussion.
